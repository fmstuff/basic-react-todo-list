## Basic ToDo list app (React Hooks & functional components)

This is a very basic ToDo list React app to showcase the fundamentals of:
* React functional components
* React Hooks (`useState`, `useRef`, and `useEffect`)

The app allows you to create a list of ToDo items, check/un-check them, and clear completed items.
It stores the list to local storage to persist it across browser page refresh.
